/// A simple function that attempts to generate a random number based on various
/// fixed input parameters.
///
/// This works using a simple (but brilliant!) and well-known trick: if you calculate the
/// dot product of a coordinate with a float2 containing two numbers that are unlikely
/// to repeat, then calculate the sine of that and multiply it by a large number, you'll
/// end up with what looks more or less like random numbers in the fraction
/// digits – i.e., everything after the decimal place.
///
/// This is perfect for our needs: those numbers will already range from 0 to
/// 0.99999... so we can use that for our color value by calling it once for each
/// of the RGB components.
///
/// - Parameter offset: A fixed value that controls pseudorandomness.
/// - Parameter position: The position of the pixel we're working with.
/// - Parameter time: The number of elapsed seconds since the shader was created.
/// - Returns: The original pixel color.
