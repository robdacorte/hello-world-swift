/// A shader that generates multiple twisting and turning lines that cycle through colors.
///
/// This shader calculates how far each pixel is from one of 10 lines.
/// Each line has its own undulating color and position based on various
/// sine waves, so the pixel's color is calculating by starting from black
/// and adding in a little of each line's color based on its distance.
///
/// - Parameter position: The user-space coordinate of the current pixel.
/// - Parameter color: The current color of the pixel.
/// - Parameter size: The size of the whole image, in user-space.
/// - Parameter time: The number of elapsed seconds since the shader was created
/// - Returns: The new pixel color.
